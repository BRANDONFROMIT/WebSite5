    <h3>Welcome to the Patient Medical Assistant.</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this application is to provide healthcare assistance, on the patient side. Much of the functionality of the PMA is for post-release patients, or patients currently undergoing treatment. There is also functionality for people searching for resources, from addresses of nearby medical facilities, to an application to track medical intake.</p>
    <p>This application was developed by Brandon Smith, for HACKRU Spring 2016.</p>
